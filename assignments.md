# Assignments

You can earn up to 1,250 points in this course. Your final grade will be calculated by the percentage of points you earned. For example, earning 1,000 points yields an 80% final grade (1000 / 1250 = 0.8).

## Profiles

You must create and maintain two social profiles throughout this course. By September 15, paste the links to your GitHub account and two other social networks in Canvas.

Profile assignments comprise 12 percent of your grade.

## Exercises

Excerise assignments comprise 20 percent of your grade. You need to fork the [exercises repository](https://github.com/gotoplanb/mmc3260-f14-exercises). Exercises are submitted by pasting the URL to your exercise file within Canvas.

## Reactions

1. [The End of the Waffle House](http://www.idsnews.com/article/2013/10/the-end-of-the-waffle-house?id=94816)
2. [Borderland](http://www.npr.org/series/291397809/borderland-dispatches-from-the-u-s-mexico-boundary)
3. [NSA Files: Decoded](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/1)

Each reaction paper should be at least 500 words and provide your thoughts on the effectivness of the story. What excelled? What could have been done better? What should have been included? Graduate students should write at least 1,000 words per reaction paper. Reaction papers are submitted by uploading a Word or similar file to Canvas.

Reaction assignments comprise 12 percent of your grade. 

## Exams

Exams are given based on lecture content and guest speakers. Lecture material will not be available online. You must come to lecture. Exams will be given during our lecture time.

Exams comprise 24 percent of your grade.

## Project

Your final project is a personal website that you will build throughout the semester following lab videos. Grading details will be added soon. You will submit your project by pasting the a link to your project within Canvas.

### Sitemap

The sitemap is a text-based document that lists the pages of your site along with the major sections and type of content that will exist on the page.

### Wireframe

The wireframe is a sketch that shows the major containers of a representative page of your site. You should show the relative size and arrangement of the heade, nav, article, aside (if you have one) and footer). Within the article, draw what type of content/HTML will likely exist. Examples for an article:

* headline
* subheading
* photo
* photo caption
* primary article text

You don't have to state the content for these elements but just something like squiggly lines for text and boxes for images.

### Composite

The composite is the next iteration of your wireframe. You may use crayons, Word, Photoshop or any other manner you want. All I care is that you in someway show how:

* color
* fonts
* imagery

will be used together on your site. For this assignment, it is also acceptable to create something like a mood board. A mood board can be a Word file that included a photo you will use, some rectangles/swatches to show your colors and some text to show your fonts. A mood board won't look at all like your wireframes, and this is okay. I'm trying to get a sense of the aesthetic and mood of your site. 

### Website submission

You'll submit an initial website. The instructors will give you quick feedback related to technical requirements. You'll submit a final website. The instructors will grade the functional requirements and adjust your grade for correct technical requirements.

#### Functional requirements

* Site viewable at {username}.github.io
* Student clearly states the intended audience
* Primary tasks are easy to complete for the targeted audience
* Wireframe properly positions information relative to like information and apart from disparate information
* Visual design shows clear intent to create a consistent feel across the site
* Consistent font usage
* Colors have specific meaning instead of arbitrary usage
* Classes and IDs have semantic meaning

#### Technical requirements

* At least 4 separate HTML pages
* At least 500 words of content
* First page is named index.html
* All filenames are lowercase
* No `!important` usage in CSS
* Links to your two social media profiles
* At least one other external link
* Include either a mailto link or an embedded contact form
* Include at least 3 images you created yourself
* No individual image is larger than 500kb
* Images are placed in an `images` subdirectory
* CSS is in a `css` subdirectory`
* Use only 1 CSS file
* Site looks good on phones and desktop
* All pages successfully validate (other than iframes)
* No grammar mistakes
* Copyright notice in the footer
* Consistent navigation placement on every page
* All text content exists in HTML and not just images

Project assignments comprise 32 percent of your grade.
