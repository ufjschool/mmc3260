This class utilizes the following grading scale:

* A) 92-100%
* A-) 90-91.99%
* B+) 88-89.99%
* B) 82-87.99%
* B-) 80-81.99%

The grading scale is non-negotiable. A final grade of 87.99%, for instance, is a B. All grades are final unless questions about grades are addressed in writing within 1 week after the grade is posted. If you have concerns about your grades please check with me sooner in the semester rather than later.
