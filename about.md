## Readings

There are no required textbooks for this course. There will, however, be several online readings required each week. You'll find these readings under the [calendar](calendar.md). The reading list will likely be updated as the semester progresses, so be sure to check it regularly.

## Lecture meetings

* Tuesdays and Thursdays, Period 6 (12:50 to 1:40 p.m.)

Please be prompt for all classes. Everyone is late occasionally, but it is impolite to your fellow students and the instructor if you regularly straggle in late. Also, turn off your cell phone during class. Many of you will bring your laptop to class. This is encouraged, but please stay on task during lecture so as not to distract the students around you.

## Labs

Labs will be conducted online this semester. Online labs will allow you to learn the material at your own rate and convenience. Each week, severalvideos will be available in for you to watch. You will be taught hands-on skills for working with multiplatform design and coding.

If you struggle with online labs, don't worry: we will also offer two optional, face-to-face lab sessions a week. Students on a first-come, first served basis.
