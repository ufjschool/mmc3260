## Lecture meetings

| Day | Period | Location |

| Tuesday | 6 | FLG 260 |

Please be prompt for all classes. Everyone is late occasionally, but it is impolite to your fellow students and the instructor if you regularly straggle in late. Also, turn off your cell phone during class. Many of you will bring your laptop to class. This is encouraged, but please stay on task during lecture so as not to distract the students around you.

## Labs

Labs will be conducted online this semester. Online labs will allow you to learn the material at your own rate and convenience. Each week, severalvideos will be available in for you to watch. You will be taught hands-on skills for working with multiplatform design and coding.

If you struggle with online labs, don't worry: we will also offer two optional, face-to-face lab sessions a week. Students on a first-come, first served basis.

| Day | Periods | Location |

| Monday | 6-7 | WEIM 2056 |

## Computer use

This course requires the use of e-Learning and email. Grades will be found on E-Learning. Students are responsible for reading announcements and emails from class. If you bring a computer to class, please use it for class-related activities only so as not to disturb students around you.

## Course evaluations

Students are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course based on 10 criteria. These ]evaluations are conducted online](https://evaluations.ufl.edu/evals/). Students will be notified when evaluations are open, which will be toward the end of the course. Your feedback is very important to us, as it helps us improve the course for future students.

## Students with disabilities

Students requesting classroom accommodation must first register with the Dean of Students Office. The Dean of Students will provide documentation of the necessary accommodation to the student who must then provide this documentation to the instructor within the first two weeks of the semester. Please expect to visit the instructor during office hours to discuss your needs. This course conforms to all requirements of the ADA and handles with sensitivity all matters related to gender, race, sexual orientation, age, religion or disability. Please alert the instructor if any issues arise.

## Emergencies and illness

Despite our best-laid plans, semesters don't always finish as strong as they start. Family emergencies, personal struggles, and illness can come up suddenly and seriously disrupt your coursework. Should an emergency happen that hinders your ability to complete your schoolwork, please let Professor Carlson know as soon as possible so that we can help you complete your schoolwork in a timely manner. Dennis was once very sick one semester of undergraduate and was hospitalized for two weeks at the end of the semester, so he knows how sudden these things can come up, and how disruptive they can be for your schooling.

If any emergency comes up this semester, please let your instructors (in your other classes as well) know as soon as possible. You don't have to fully reveal the nature of your emergency, but the more upfront you are with your instructors, the more willing they are to work with you. And if something comes up it's nothing to be embarrassed about: it happens to at least a couple students every semester in a large class like this, so we are used to meeting students' needs.
